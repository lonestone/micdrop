# @micdrop/advanced

The full featured demo of [Micdrop](../../README.md), client and server in one
folder. Every provider the project ships with is wired in, and the call is
configured from the browser rather than from the code.

- [`client/`](./client) is a React application built with Vite, using
  [@micdrop/client](../../packages/client/README.md) and
  [@micdrop/react](../../packages/react/README.md)
- [`server/`](./server) is a Fastify server using
  [@micdrop/server](../../packages/server/README.md)

For a much shorter starting point, read [the basic example](../basic) first.

## Development

Copy the example environment file and fill in the API keys of the providers you
want to try:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then, from the root of the repository, build the packages once and start both
sides together:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm dev:advanced
```

➡️ Client on http://localhost:8080, server on port 8081.

Other commands, run from this folder:

```bash
pnpm dev:client    # Client alone, with hot reload
pnpm dev:server    # Server alone, with hot reload
pnpm build         # Build both into dist/
pnpm start         # Run the built server
pnpm typecheck     # Typecheck both sides
```

## Choosing providers

The selects at the top of the page pick the agent, the transcription and the
voice for the next call. The server exposes what it can run on
`GET /providers`, the client sends back what was picked when a call starts, and
a provider whose key is missing or whose binary is not installed appears greyed
out rather than failing mid-call. The selection is kept in the browser storage,
so it survives a reload.

Providers live in `server/src/providers`, one file per part of a call. Adding
one means adding one entry to the matching registry, and it shows up in the
client on the next page load.

The checkboxes under the selects turn the agent prompts on and off for the next
call: ending the call on its own, waiting on an unfinished sentence, and
skipping an answer when the transcript carries no speech. The client sends them
with the call and the server logs the ones left off. Each one costs the model a
tool call on every turn, and a small model handles them less reliably than a
hosted one, so unticking them one at a time shows which one a model mishandles.
Hover a label for what it does.

## Running locally

The local providers need no API key and keep everything on the machine. Whisper
and Kokoro download their weights on first use, so the first call is slower than
the ones after it.

For the agent, install [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and pull a model:

```bash
brew services start ollama
ollama pull qwen3:4b-instruct
```

Pulling a model talks to the Ollama daemon, so the daemon has to be up first.
Running `ollama serve` works too, in a terminal of its own, since it holds the
one it runs in.

For a voice in another language than English, install Piper and download a voice
into `examples/advanced/server/voices`, where the demo looks for them:

```bash
pip install piper-tts
mkdir -p server/voices && cd server/voices
BASE=https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main/fr/fr_FR/siwis/medium
curl -LO $BASE/fr_FR-siwis-medium.onnx
curl -LO $BASE/fr_FR-siwis-medium.onnx.json
```

Every voice of the [samples page](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples/) is
downloaded the same way, with its own path in the repository.

The [local models guide](https://micdrop.dev/docs/ai-integration/local-models)
covers the models worth picking and what they cost in latency and memory.
