# Welcome to Micdrop

**Micdrop** is a set of open-source TypeScript packages designed to build real-time voice conversations with AI agents. It handles all the complexities of browser and server-side voice processing, including microphone input, speaker output, voice activity detection (VAD), network communication, and AI provider integrations.

## Why Micdrop?

While real-time multimodal models (voice-to-voice) offer impressive capabilities, they often come with limitations in terms of customization and cost. Micdrop takes a different approach by:

üéØ **Allowing you to choose the best-in-class API for each component:**
- Select specific voices from TTS providers
- Use different LLMs optimized for your use case  
- Pick STT engines suited for specific languages/accents

üí∞ **Reducing costs by letting you:**
- Use more cost-effective API providers
- Mix open source and commercial solutions
- Control exactly when APIs are called

üîß **Providing granular control** over the conversation flow

üåê **Supporting a wider range** of languages and voices through specialized providers

This modular approach gives you the flexibility to build voice applications that are both powerful and cost-effective.
