# Welcome to Micdrop documentation

**Micdrop** is a set of open source Typescript packages to build real-time voice conversations with AI agents.

It handles all the complexities on the browser and server side (microphone, speaker, VAD, network communication, etc) and provides ready-to-use implementations for various AI providers.

Build powerful voice AI applications with our modular architecture - choose your preferred STT, TTS, and LLM providers while we handle the complexities of audio streaming, voice activity detection, and WebSocket communication.
