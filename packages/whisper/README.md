# @micdrop/whisper

[Micdrop website](https://micdrop.dev) | [Documentation](https://micdrop.dev/docs/ai-integration/provided-integrations/whisper)

Local Whisper speech to text for [@micdrop/server](https://micdrop.dev/docs/server).

Runs in your Node process through Transformers.js and ONNX Runtime, so there is
no API key, no server to start next to your own, and no audio leaving the
machine. The weights are downloaded on first use and shared by every call.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @micdrop/whisper
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { WhisperSTT } from '@micdrop/whisper'
import { MicdropServer } from '@micdrop/server'

const stt = new WhisperSTT({
  model: 'base', // tiny, base, small, turbo, french, or any ONNX repository
  language: 'en',
})

// Use with MicdropServer
new MicdropServer(socket, {
  stt,
  // ... other options
})
```

## Picking a model

A checkpoint fine-tuned on one language beats a much heavier generic one. On
French sentences carrying proper nouns, numbers and homophones, the `french`
shorthand makes around 2% word errors where `turbo` makes 17%, at a third of
the latency and a fraction of the download.

```typescript
const stt = new WhisperSTT({ model: 'french', language: 'fr' })
```
