Local [Pocket TTS](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts) text to speech for
[@micdrop/server](https://micdrop.dev/docs/server).

Runs in your Node process through the sherpa-onnx addon and ONNX Runtime, so
there is no API key, no Python next to your server, and no text leaving the
machine. Pocket TTS is a 100 million parameter model from Kyutai, built for the
CPU, that clones the voice of a few seconds of reference audio and hands its
audio over while it is still generating the rest.

It speaks English. Use [@micdrop/piper](https://micdrop.dev/docs/ai-integration/provided-integrations/piper)
for the other languages.

## Installation

Install the package:

```bash
npm install @micdrop/pocket-tts
```

Download the weights, converted to ONNX by the sherpa-onnx project:

```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/download/tts-models/sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-int8-2026-01-26.tar.bz2
tar xf sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-int8-2026-01-26.tar.bz2
rm sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-int8-2026-01-26.tar.bz2
```

The archive weighs 98 MB and takes 190 MB on disk. A full precision archive,
`sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-2026-01-26.tar.bz2`, exists next to it and is read the
same way.

## Usage

```typescript
import { PocketTTS } from '@micdrop/pocket-tts'
import { MicdropServer } from '@micdrop/server'

const tts = new PocketTTS({
  modelDir: './sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-int8-2026-01-26',
  voice: 'bria', // or the path to a wav of the voice to clone
})

// Use with MicdropServer
new MicdropServer(socket, {
  tts,
  // ... other options
})
```

## Voices

The voice comes from a reference recording rather than from a catalog: a few
seconds of someone speaking is enough for the model to answer in that voice.
The archive ships three samples in its `test_wavs` folder, reachable by name
through `BUNDLED_VOICES`, and any wav file works in their place.

```typescript
const tts = new PocketTTS({
  modelDir: './sherpa-onnx-pocket-tts-int8-2026-01-26',
  voice: './voices/my-voice.wav',
})
```

Clone a voice only with the consent of the person it belongs to, which the
[Kyutai license](https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts#prohibited-use)
requires.
