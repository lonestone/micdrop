/**
 * Local Pocket TTS text to speech, running in the Node process through the
 * sherpa-onnx addon and ONNX Runtime. Nothing leaves the machine and no server
 * has to be started next to it.
 *
 * Pocket TTS is a 100 million parameter model from Kyutai, built for the CPU,
 * that clones the voice of a few seconds of reference audio. It generates
 * several times faster than real time and hands its audio over while it is
 * still writing the rest, so the first words of a sentence reach the client in
 * about three hundred milliseconds.
 *
 * The weights are downloaded separately, see the README.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/kyutai-labs/pocket-tts
