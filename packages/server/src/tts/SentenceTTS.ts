/**
 * Base class for text to speech engines that read a whole input at once.
 *
 * A local model, and a remote endpoint without a streaming interface, cannot
 * be fed the agent's answer token by token. This class buffers the answer into
 * sentences, hands them over one at a time, and emits the audio in the order
 * they were written. Subclasses only have to turn one sentence into PCM16 at
 * the rate the Micdrop client expects.
 *
 * Sentences are synthesized one after the other rather than at once: a local
 * model is single threaded, so racing two sentences through it slows both down
 * without bringing the first word any closer.
